## 🏗 Repository Structure

This repository is modularized to separate academic research from production-grade code:

* **`2_Solutions/`**: Academic-specific modules for Ethics and Security.
* **`POPPY_Universe/`**: The production codebase.
    * `Recommendation_Engine/`: Proprietary logic for user/star matching.
    * `Machine_Learning/`: Model training scripts and forecasting logic.
    * `Web/Backend/`: Server-side architecture and API implementation.
    * `Web/Frontend/`: Client-side interface (deployed on Vercel).
    * `Data_Notebooks/`: The engine room, containing the full **ETL** pipeline.

> **Note:** For more granular technical details, please refer to the **detailed README files** located within each specific sub-directory.
